Below some regex expressions to help parsing copy pasted data from last.fm

To retrieve play dates from last.fm go to a song and copy all the info from the song's chart
(the chart's format is %name% %artist% %play time%)
Copy those to a text file. You'll end up with a file like this:
%name%
%artist%
%play time%
Then use the following regex to convert the data to a format readable by this project's script

+ Remove non data
Search for: ^[a-zA-Z].*\r\n
Replace with: (empty)

+ Remove comas
Search for: , .*
Replace with: (empty)

+ Convert listening time to current year (2019 for example)
Search for: [0-9]*:[0-9]*..
Replace with: 2019
